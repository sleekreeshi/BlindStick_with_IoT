# BlindStick_with_IoT
The stick uses IoT, echolocation, image processing, artificial intelligence, and navigation system technology to identify close and far obstacles for the user. If the blind person falls or has some other problem, then the system will send a warning to the designated person.

Componenets Required 
1.Arduino UNO
2.Ultrasonic Sensor(HC-SR04)
3.Buzzer
4.Breadboard
5.Jumper
6.LED

The proposed smart stick has two modes; one uses ultrasonic sensors for detection and feedback through vibration motors to inform about the direction of the obstacle, and the second mode is the detection and recognition of obstacles and providing voice feedback.
